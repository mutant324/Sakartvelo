                   <li>Behavioral data (browsing logs, IP addresses, cookies, device, or browser).</li>
                   <li>Any other information that could identify you as an individual.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Our website/app operates completely anonymously and does not use tracking, analytics, or data collection methods.</p>

               <h2>2. How do we use data?</h2>
               <p>Since we do not collect data, we do not use it for any purposes, including:</p>

               <h2>3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
               <p>We do not use cookies, pixels, scripts, or other tracking technologies. If your browser sets standard technical cookies (such as session cookies) by default, they are not transmitted to us and are deleted automatically.</p>

               <h2>4. Sharing Data with Third Parties</h2>
               <p>We do not share any data (including anonymized data) with third parties, including partners, advertisers, or analytics services.</p>

               <h2>5. Security</h2>

               <p>We may update this Policy in the future. Changes will be posted here. We recommend that you check it periodically.</p>
